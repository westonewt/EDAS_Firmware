This systemd service automatically launches the EDAS GUI application at boot on a Raspberry Pi, ensuring the graphical interface starts once the desktop environment is ready. It’s designed to run under the edas user’s session.

The service file is located at:

/home/edas/.config/systemd/user/edas-gui.service
